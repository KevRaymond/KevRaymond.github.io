			<title>Am I Like a Horse, Only Offering Manual Labor?</title>

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ho1wf669xlbe199/Labor%20Horses.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading a post this morning entitled, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.pmarca.com/2014/06/13/this-is-probably-a-good-time-to-say-that-i-dont-believe-robots-will-eat-all-the-jobs/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is Probably a Good Time to Say That I Don’t Believe Robots Will Eat All the Jobs …&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on Marc Andreesen's blog, I came across a troubling quote. The article itself is great and has many ideas I will probably post about in the future. This one quote got me thinking though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the subtext to the “this time is different” argument that there won’t be new ideas, fields, industries, businesses, and jobs. In arguing this with an economist friend, his response was, “But most people are like horses; they have only their manual labor to offer…” I don’t believe that, and I don’t want to live in a world in which that’s the case. I think people everywhere have far more potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm glad Marc disagrees and wonder who this economist friend is, underestimating the society he lives in. Although, I can relate on some level. There have been many days through my working life where I have felt like a pack mule, driving goods for nothing more than a meal at the end of the day. The deal being, I work hard, get paid and live a happy life with friends and family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, my thinking has changed since I made the decision to take-over the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kesheetmetal.com&quot;&gt;family business&lt;/a&gt; full time. Learning how to run a company with no business acumen has given me ambition to be more than just as pack mule waiting for the next carrot. I love running the fabrication company, building things needed in the industry I have grown up in. I have respect and work friends whom I've known since I was a teenager. This is who I have always been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is, I want more and always have. Different things interest me, new and old. My assumption is, this is the same for everyone. However, my choices through the years have put me where I am today and that's fine. For now. The question is, will I be satisfied with my place or will I do my best and find what makes me happy, to be better? Can I find something else to drive my ambition, creativity and knowledge? All my life I have been held down by anxiety and fears. I know these are not who I am. We all deal with anxiety and fears. The people who can use those deficiencies to their advantage are those who succeed and are ultimately happy with themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have let the fears lead, leaving me to assume my only skills and contribution to society are based on manual labor. The reason I write this blog or learn about business is because I like it. I read lots of different material and write everyday because it makes me happy. I get up for work, day in and day out because it's something I enjoy. Writing is happiness and very therapeutic for me, even if it's the dumbest tweet on the board. Learning how to code and new technology interests me. People who make money from things other than the manual labor I have always known, fascinate me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning for myself and being something I can be proud of is what I want my future to be. Letting the past dictate where I will go is not what I want and neither should you. Whatever has been told to you should not be the gospel of your life. Figure it out for yourself and don't let others tell you the only thing you're good at is manual labor, or whatever manual labor is for you. We all have brains. The goal is using it to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Takeaways From My First Outdoor Phish Show in Years</title>
			<link>http://kevinraymond.smallpict.com/2014/07/05/takeawayaFromMyFirstOutdoorPhishShowInYears.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ztrblu1ridldv1k/Photo%20Jul%2005%2C%201%2017%2016%20PM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a fan of Phish, not a Phish fan. Meaning, I enjoy the music. Mainly because I play the guitar and enjoy when the band is playing really well. I like to hear how Trey comes in and out, leaving space for the others but, also taking the jam his way. Plus, I LOVE his guitar. Honestly, I want &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.languedocguitars.com/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/zstpy1rj7ihlji4/Photo%20Feb%2003%2C%201%2006%2038%20PM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Phish fan is the &quot;all in&quot; individual who loves the music and everything that goes with the culture of all that is Phish. I am amazed by the analytic nature of a Phish fan. The ability to remember intricate sections of tunes from tours past is fascinating. Knowing when the band is changing from song to song, note to note and comparing it to a show from the 90's. They all have minds like steel traps when it comes to the band they love. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are the newbies, riff raff and the most interesting takeaway for me. The entrepreneurs, who seem to have built a traveling flea market. This was not around when I went to Phish shows in the 90's at SPAC. T-shirt salesman, drug pushers, pipes etc. were present and they would come around with a back pack or whatever. But the vibe was more about the community of fans coming together, haveing some drinks, a toke or 20 and enjoying the show. Now the &quot;lot scene&quot; is a village of tents and food trucks selling everything from pizza to tie dye sneakers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food looked delicious and I did enjoy a Chimechanga from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://esperantosaratoga.com/&quot;&gt;Esperanto&lt;/a&gt; food truck. Which kinda makes my point. A local restaurant never would have parked a food truck in the lot during shows past. Yesterday there were many and details the acceptance of Phish culture locally and probably the rise of the food truck. I have no problem with the selling of things. My interest was more about how prevalent the flea market aspect had become. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I am a fan of Phish and don't frequent shows around the country. I catch local shows. Therefore, I've missed a lot of the band and fan base evolution. This has probably gone on for years and by the comments I was getting from my friends--Phish fans--it seems to have been going on a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all the show was terrific. I have not heard the newer songs and was lost during some of the jams, I was happy with Reba, 46 Days and especially the Character Zero closer. Apparently they also played Down With Disease, a favorite, which I am failing to remember. I bought some moonshine at the flea market--could be the reason--and realized my age of 36 this morning. Gotta learn when to say no &lt;img title=':blush:' alt=':blush:' class='emoji' src='http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/blush.png' align='absmiddle' /&gt;. Here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://phish.net/setlists/?d=2014-07-04&quot;&gt;full setlist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part, as always, is hanging out with your best friends, enjoying music and people you love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best takeaway for me.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>The New Website is Up!</title>
			<link>http://kevinraymond.smallpict.com/2014/07/03/theNewWebsiteIsUpAndRunning.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/z9b1lca14rawjay/Bruins%20Cheering.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a week of schizophrenic fits, I finally came to a conclusion regarding my personal website. All of this came about after discovering Fargo, my new favorite outliner/web publisher. Over the years my personal website/blogs have been disjointed and boring. Yes, this could happen again, but I hope not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new &lt;a href=&quot;http://kevraymond.com&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/docs/blogging/linkblogging.html&quot;&gt;link blog&lt;/a&gt; using Jeffrey Kisner's &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeffreykishner.com/wordpress-plugins/post-opml-to-wordpress/&quot;&gt;OPML to Wordpress plugin&lt;/a&gt;. The new domain is kevraymond.com and I decided to host the main site with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bluehost.com/&quot;&gt;Bluehost&lt;/a&gt; and use Wordpress, with which I have some basic skills. The blog is located at blog.kevraymond.com, where you are now and hosted via &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; so I can use Fargo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with kevraymond.com instead of my already owned kevinraymond.net because I hate .net's. And, whomever owns kevinraymond.com renews every year and doesn't even have a site on the domain. Enraging! The process to try and buy it is something I do not want to deal with so, kevraymond.com is born. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, it's the same as my &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/KevRaymond&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; handle so it works out ok in the end. Plus, it makes me sound friendly &lt;img title=':blush:' alt=':blush:' class='emoji' src='http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/blush.png' align='absmiddle' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the main site is a list of daily links I have read, found interesting and want to share. Each link may or may not have a comment or quote from me or the article. For referance, I won't put up a link unless I have read the article or a least skimmed it well (ya know, for those puff pieces). I hate random links. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days there may be one or two, others, maybe more. The whole thing depends on how busy the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kesheetmetal.com&quot;&gt;fabrication shop&lt;/a&gt; is. Everything is a work in progress and like I've said before, I want to use my brain and code some stuff, learning in the process. Therefore, things may change or have an issue here and there as I fix, research and ask questions about my problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One arose yesterday and @kisner graciously fixed the issue &lt;img title=':blush:' alt=':blush:' class='emoji' src='http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/blush.png' align='absmiddle' /&gt;. Below is our Twitter conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

				<source:outline text="After a week of schizophrenic fits, I finally came to a conclusion regarding my personal website. All of this came about after discovering Fargo, my new favorite outliner/web publisher. Over the years my personal website/blogs have been disjointed and boring.

				<source:outline text="My new [website](http://kevraymond.com) is a [link blog](http://fargo.io/docs/blogging/linkblogging.html) using Jeffrey Kisner's [OPML to Wordpress plugin](http://jeffreykishner.com/wordpress-plugins/post-opml-to-wordpress/). The new domain is kevraymond.com and I decided to host the main site with [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/) and use Wordpress, with which I have some basic skills. The blog is located at blog.kevraymond.com, where you are now and hosted via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) so I can use Fargo." created="Thu, 03 Jul 2014 12:59:59 GMT" />
				<source:outline text="I decided to go with kevraymond.com instead of my already owned kevinraymond.net because I hate .net's.

			<title>The Personal Website Battle Continues</title>
			<link>http://kevinraymond.smallpict.com/2014/07/01/thePersonalWebsiteBattleContinues.html</link>
			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropbox.com/s/lmyqoub545xcuoj/The%20Battle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some careful reading of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/docs/contentManagement/usingGithub.html&quot;&gt;directions&lt;/a&gt;, a few hours of missteps and some coffee. I successfully used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; Pages to host my Fargo blog at &lt;a href=&quot;http://kevinraymond.net/&quot;&gt;kevinraymond.net&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few things I learned....&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Github, committing is kinda like publishing.&lt;/strong&gt; Once you have rendered the pages in Fargo, they are added to the folder in your Dropbox ( if you have added, #siteFolder &quot;username.github.io&quot; in your outline. It's in the directions.) and ready to be committed in the Github program on your Mac or Windows machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I use a Chromebook&lt;/strong&gt;, but have a Windows computer at work which I can log into anytime I need. Therefore, I can render my pages and go to my Windows machine remotely to commit them in the Github program. I guess this is what you would call a work around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading directions is key&lt;/strong&gt;. So read them &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/docs/contentManagement/usingGithub.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patience is your friend.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the main reasons I got so frustrated was my lack of patience for things to reconcile on the server etc. Waiting 10 minutes was like an eternity. I blame society for this. I think the best pet detective in the biz, Ace Ventura said it best, &quot;If I'm not back in five minutes. Just wait longer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excitement of the accomplishment was euphoric. Strange for something so simple. I have basic computing skills, but this was my first venture into something this tricky. And honestly, it wasn't difficult after taking the time to check all my steps. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am wondering if hosting a regular site at kevinraymond.net is better and using something like blog.kevinraymond.net for the blog, which would be hosted through Github. I have no idea if this makes sense or if I am being a non savvy computer person. ( Apologies for lack of terminology if you're reading this and live in the computing world. I fabricate sheet metal for a living so I am kind of a layman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. My thought is, I could host the main site, giving me the ability to create sub pages like blog.kevinraymond.net and links.kevinraymond.net for my Fargo blog and link page. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I on the right track? I realize there are so many ways to get a site started. I am hoping to keep it low cost and use my brain to figure some things out. Plus, it's fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any suggestions please leave them in the comments or tweet me &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/KevRaymond&quot;&gt;@KevRaymond&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>
				&lt;p&gt;I am totally loving this outline but, I fishing in some new waters here. The fascination I have with technology and the internet is rivaled only by my love for business, sports and ladies. The order is ever changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt; as a blogging platform is going to take some patience on my part. There will be some issues with the blog from time to time as I figure out the methods of writing some simple code, update the site, learn how to host it etc. etc. etc. However, I am up for the challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, I just watched an episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amctv.com/shows/halt-and-catch-fire&quot;&gt;Halt and Catch Fire&lt;/a&gt;, so I am completely ready to deal with any and all computing issues &lt;img title=':blush:' alt=':blush:' class='emoji' src='http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/blush.png' align='absmiddle' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figuring out how to keep a new page from showing up in the blog stream. An example being the page called 'The Deets' at the bottom of this blog. Scroll to the bottom of the home page and you will see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://7386e7752d6b2382f0aa0f4b66fcb10a0ce5110d.googledrive.com/host/0B1yv2qFDpLE6N1Q3anFwNU4zS28/Fargo%20Deets%20Shot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting a picture to show up from Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is going to be a work in progress and I will enjoy every minute. Granted, I have a business to run so it will be a slow go but, I want to finally have a blog I enjoy from all aspects. I have tried to blog many times, only to get bored and change everything around. Nothing ever seemed to work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is this. If I am going to succeed at having a blog people want to read I have to do it the right way, make the effort and learn along the way. This blog will be about my life, a chronicle of what I find interesting and journeys I will have. Creating the thing is obstacle 1 and will probably be a focus of the topics for some time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm excited &lt;img title=':blush:' alt=':blush:' class='emoji' src='http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/blush.png' align='absmiddle' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;I love simple things. I don't enjoy all the pomp and circumstance of things. Blogging in general has become so complicated and money driven. The biggest &quot;blogs&quot; of today consist of Huffington Post and Buzzfeed. These are full fledged online businesses, not blogs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fargo, even though there is a learning curve for me, is the coolest and simplest way to blog.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently, like a week ago, purchased a subscription to the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://ghost.org/&quot;&gt;Ghost blogging&lt;/a&gt; service. A stripped down way to blog, which I like. Yet, now I feel like I may have to cancel and go strictly with Fargo for all my online posting and organizing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt; give me the ability to blog, it fulfills my occasional need to code or play around with code. Plus, I can keep organized on personal and work projects privately.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I not hear about any of this before!? &lt;strong&gt;I read!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will this show up if not rendered?&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>My First Fargo Blog Post</title>

				&lt;p&gt;This is my first Fargo blog post. I thought I was going to be reading about someone in the new, fantastic TV show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when I tab in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does markdown work here? This is my current blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://kevinraymond.net&quot;&gt;kevinraymond.net&lt;/a&gt;. If so, then my blog should be linked &lt;img title=':blush:' alt=':blush:' class='emoji' src='http://fargo.io/code/emojify/images/emoji/blush.png' align='absmiddle' /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kesheetmetal.com&quot;&gt;http://kesheetmetal.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, there it is! So far I am loving Fargo to blog with. And the ability to keep a whole bunch of other stuff noted and outlined is kinda cool as well. Have not tried any of the latter yet but I am excited to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a test photo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sullydish.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/iraq-parliament-architecture-assemblange.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FYI: I got absolutely NOTHING done today because I have been playing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://farg.io&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt; for hours!&lt;/p&gt;
