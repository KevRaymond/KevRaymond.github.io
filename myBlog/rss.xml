			<title>This is Gonna Take Some Work</title>

				&lt;p&gt;I am totally loving this outline but, I fishing in some new waters here. The fascination I have with technology and the internet is rivaled only by my love for business, sports and ladies. The order is ever changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt; as a blogging platform is going to take some patience on my part. There will be some issues with the blog from time to time as I figure out the methods of writing some simple code, update the site, learn how to host it etc. etc. etc. However, I am up for the challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, I just watched an episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amctv.com/shows/halt-and-catch-fire&quot;&gt;Halt and Catch Fire&lt;/a&gt;, so I am completely ready to deal with any and all computing issues :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figuring out how to keep a new page from showing up in the blog stream. An example being the page called 'The Deets' at the bottom of this blog. Scroll to the bottom of the home page and you will see what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://7386e7752d6b2382f0aa0f4b66fcb10a0ce5110d.googledrive.com/host/0B1yv2qFDpLE6N1Q3anFwNU4zS28/Fargo%20Deets%20Shot.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting a picture to show up from Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is going to be a work in progress and I will enjoy every minute. Granted, I have a business to run so it will be a slow go but, I want to finally have a blog I enjoy from all aspects. I have tried to blog many times, only to get bored and change everything around. Nothing ever seemed to work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is this. If I am going to succeed at having a blog people want to read I have to do it the right way, make the effort and learn along the way. This blog will be about my life, a chronicle of what I find interesting and journeys I will have. Creating the thing is obstacle 1 and will probably be a focus of the topics for some time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm excited :)&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;I love simple things. I don't enjoy all the pomp and circumstance of things. Blogging in general has become so complicated and money driven. The biggest &quot;blogs&quot; of today consist of Huffington Post and Buzzfeed. These are full fledged online businesses, not blogs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fargo, even though there is a learning curve for me, is the coolest and simplest way to blog.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently, like a week ago, purchased a subscription to the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://ghost.org/&quot;&gt;Ghost blogging&lt;/a&gt; service. A stripped down way to blog, which I like. Yet, now I feel like I may have to cancel and go strictly with Fargo for all my online posting and organizing needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does &lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io/&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt; give me the ability to blog, it fulfills my occasional need to code or play around with code. Plus, I can keep organized on personal and work projects privately.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I not hear about any of this before!? &lt;strong&gt;I read!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will this show up if not rendered?&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>My First Fargo Blog Post</title>
			<link>http://kevinraymond.smallpict.com/2014/06/27/myFirstFargoBlogPost.html</link>

				&lt;p&gt;This is my first Fargo blog post. I thought I was going to be reading about someone in the new, fantastic TV show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when I tab in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does markdown work here? This is my current blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://kevinraymond.net&quot;&gt;kevinraymond.net&lt;/a&gt;. If so, then my blog should be linked :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kesheetmetal.com&quot;&gt;http://kesheetmetal.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, there it is! So far I am loving Fargo to blog with. And the ability to keep a whole bunch of other stuff noted and outlined is kinda cool as well. Have not tried any of the latter yet but I am excited to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a test photo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://sullydish.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/iraq-parliament-architecture-assemblange.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FYI: I got absolutely NOTHING done today because I have been playing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://farg.io&quot;&gt;Fargo&lt;/a&gt; for hours!&lt;/p&gt;
