<p>Reading a post this morning entitled, <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2014/06/13/this-is-probably-a-good-time-to-say-that-i-dont-believe-robots-will-eat-all-the-jobs/"><em>This is Probably a Good Time to Say That I Don’t Believe Robots Will Eat All the Jobs …</em></a>, on Marc Andreesen's blog, I came across a troubling quote. The article itself is great and has many ideas I will probably post about in the future. This one quote got me thinking though. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the subtext to the “this time is different” argument that there won’t be new ideas, fields, industries, businesses, and jobs. In arguing this with an economist friend, his response was, “But most people are like horses; they have only their manual labor to offer…” I don’t believe that, and I don’t want to live in a world in which that’s the case. I think people everywhere have far more potential.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm glad Marc disagrees and wonder who this economist friend is, underestimating the society he lives in. Although, I can relate on some level. There have been many days through my working life where I have felt like a pack mule, driving goods for nothing more than a meal at the end of the day. The deal being, I work hard, get paid and live a happy life with friends and family. </p>

<p>Yet, my thinking has changed since I made the decision to take-over the <a href="http://kesheetmetal.com">family business</a> full time. Learning how to run a company with no business acumen has given me ambition to be more than just as pack mule waiting for the next carrot. I love running the fabrication company, building things needed in the industry I have grown up in. I have respect and work friends whom I've known since I was a teenager. This is who I have always been.</p>

<p>The truth is, I want more and always have. Different things interest me, new and old. My assumption is, this is the same for everyone. However, my choices through the years have put me where I am today and that's fine. For now. The question is, will I be satisfied with my place or will I do my best and find what makes me happy, to be better? Can I find something else to drive my ambition, creativity and knowledge? All my life I have been held down by anxiety and fears. I know these are not who I am. We all deal with anxiety and fears. The people who can use those deficiencies to their advantage are those who succeed and are ultimately happy with themselves.</p>

<p>I have let the fears lead, leaving me to assume my only skills and contribution to society are based on manual labor. The reason I write this blog or learn about business is because I like it. I read lots of different material and write everyday because it makes me happy. I get up for work, day in and day out because it's something I enjoy. Writing is happiness and very therapeutic for me, even if it's the dumbest tweet on the board. Learning how to code and new technology interests me. People who make money from things other than the manual labor I have always known, fascinate me.</p>

<p>Learning for myself and being something I can be proud of is what I want my future to be. Letting the past dictate where I will go is not what I want and neither should you. Whatever has been told to you should not be the gospel of your life. Figure it out for yourself and don't let others tell you the only thing you're good at is manual labor, or whatever manual labor is for you. We all have brains. The goal is using it to the fullest.</p>
